# Breathe-io

## Overview
The Breathe.io service offers two main service tiers: Free Tier and Business Tier. Each service provides specific features to help users monitor air quality and receive recommendations related to health and environmental impact. In the Business Tier, business users can monitor their company's carbon emissions and receive more detailed reports on air quality and emissions across multiple locations.
